		<p>To get the whiskers of the cat to remain clearly visible along with the white patch on it's face and chest I chose to threshold the image at 159. For the hidden text image i chose to tresthold at 1 because at that level the text is white while the background is still completely black.</p>

		<p>Between the threshold levels 109 to 137  leave the text visible while the background still looks white. I found that the threshold level 123 allowed for the whitest background while leaving the text easily visible. That being said, any of the threshold levels between 109 to 137 would be fine depending on your personal preference</p>

		<h2>Question 3</h2>
		<a href='squaresWithCirclesDone.png'><img src="squaresWithCirclesDone.png" style='float: left;'></a>
		<p>To create the image I first used photoshop to create three squares of different couours. The eyedropper tool was then used along with HSB sliders to change the hue of the coulor while leaving the saturation and brightness the same. THe chosen couours were mamde into circles thet were put on top of the squares. Note that the "greyscale" function in photoshop desaturates the image incorrectly but the Gimp "desaturate" tool makes the image look as it should when desaturated.</p>

		<h2>Question 4</h2>
		<a href='sheet_musicDone.png'><img src="sheet_musicDone.png" style='float: right;'></a>
		<p>I chose to edit this iage in Gimp. First the "edge sobel" tool was used to find the edges. Then I inverted the colours to swap black and white so that it resembles the original. In the inhanced image you can see thet the text is much harder to read than that in the original and the scribbles in pen after the second Vcl blends in with the note before and the rest just after it. Overall I find it harder to tell what is going on in the "enhanced image" because the filled in shapes are necissary to be able to read sheet music. Without the notes filled in it is very difficult to tell a quarter note from a half note and so I feel the "enhancements" do not fulfill their intended purpose in this case.</p>
