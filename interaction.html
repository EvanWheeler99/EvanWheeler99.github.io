	<h1>Interaction</h1>

	<p>For the interaction assignment I decided to play "Gravity Bone" and record what happens. The format below is "action -> consequence" for the different things I did in my playthrough</p>
	<br>
	<br>

	<p>
		First Level<br>
		<br>
		Open the door to the exit, stand in the exit zone, and press the red button -> Buzzer sound andnothing happens.<br><br>
		Go up the stairs and follow a server into the employees only door -> leads to a furnace room.<br><br>
		Jump over the bars in the furnace room and open the briefcase -> game tells you to deliver the drink to the man with red hair and gives you an outfit and a drink to take. <br><br>
		Follow the stairs up to the roof and deliver the drink to the man with red hair standing on the balcony -> He takes the drink and drinks it before burping up green gas, then the game tells you to find the exit. <br><br>
		Jump off the from the waterfall to the level below -> die from falling to high and go back to the autosave by the red-haired man. <br><br>
		Go back down the stairs to the exit (as the security guards watch you), walk back to the exit zone and press the button -> Contract is done comes up on screen and shows a video about the Manitoba beat bug and says that I have earned $300 for completing the contract. <br><br>
		<br>
		Second Level<br>
		<br>
		Go up in an elevator and walk into a room with a few old guys and one woman<br><br>
		Follow the sign to the furnace room -> there is a hammer and pressurized Freon for you to pick up<br><br>
		Get to a door with a lock on it -> you can spray it with the Freon and then use the hammer to break the lock. <br><br>
		Get to the furnace room and open the briefcase -> Gives you a camera and tells you to photograph 5 birds.<br><br>
		Go to a different room and get to a red door with a white bomb on it that has 2 locks -> Like before you can open them with the spray and then the hammer. <br><br>
		Use the camera to take a pic of the bird inside -> a sound goes off and after getting its photo taken the bird jumps down and explodes. <br><br>
		Take a photo of something that is not a bird -> a different sound plays. <br><br>
		Go to the other rooms and take photos of the birds (jump across the pipes and flags to get to the last few) -> complete your mission and get to go to the room you started in only this time the woman is the only other person there.<br><br>
		Go to the exit zone and press the red button ->  The woman shoots you, takes your camera, and jumps out the window. <br><br>
		Chase the woman out the window and into a tunnel -> a train comes and it will kill you if you do not duck into the left while it goes by. <br><br>
		Continue following her through a boardroom and out of the building -> She shoots you off the side and you start having flashbacks as you slowly fall to your death. <br><br>
		Click exit on the main menu and then press n on your keyboard -> Cheering sounds play.
		Click exit again but this time press y on the keyboard -> The game closes. <br><br>
