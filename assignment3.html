	<a href='exampleWorldsMap.png'><img src="exampleWorldsMap.png"></a>

	<p>My design of a net art piece is a world map representing viewership of the 2018 League of Legends World Championships. The idea is to start with a blank world map and add blips to it whenever a person views the event. Thus, over the duration of the event the map will be filled in by viewers around the world.</p>
	<p>The <a href='https://www.lolesports.com/en_US/'>League of Legends world championship</a> is an annual competition where professional League of Legends teams compete against other teams from all over the world to win the summoners cup. The format of the tournament is similar to that of traditional sports in that there are multiple seeding stages leading up to a final bracket. However, the tournament differs from traditional sports in that you will not be able to witness it played out on television. THe event is streamed online through <a href='https://www.youtube.com/'>YouTube</a> and <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/'>Twitch.tv</a> to millions of viewers. This means that the viewership statistics for the torunament are easy to track.</p>
	<p>My net art piece would require that I track the concurrent viewership for all of the matches during the tournament. To do this I would need to track where the YouTube and Twitch.tv streams are sending their packets too. Because the map will most likely be very dense in some areas, different brightness levels may be needed to represent areas of high viewership. All of the data I would need for the project would come from the viewership data of the streams. To implement the actual art piece it would be difficult to accurately place the colours on the map. If I were to actually make this piece, a program that would take the data and put it onto the map would be necissary. To add another level of activity to the piece, live viewership could be represented on another map. This way someone could see where people are watching from during the game. To do this the data would need to be collected and represented on the map in real time.</p>
