	<p>For my final project I decided to remake the first "Silver Shroud" radio play from Fallout 4. I voiced all of the characters and recorded the intro riff. The sound effects for footsteps and gunshots were taken from the internet from sources that made them available free for personal use. The image was made in gimp and edited from a screenshot I took in-game.</p>
